    <h1>Active Research Programs</h1>
    <p>
      ThermoFlow is currently conducting two independent, early-stage research programs that apply the same surface-science foundation to distinct thermofluid challenges.

      <h2>Mobile Fog-Harvesting Harp</h2>
      <p>
        Fog harvesting offers access to atmospheric water in regions where liquid water is scarce, but existing collectors suffer from poor performance under low-wind conditions and significant losses due to droplet retention and re-entrainment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mobile Fog-Harvesting Harp investigates a <strong>surface-enabled fog-collection mechanism</strong> that integrates aerodynamic conditioning of fog-laden airflow with <strong>patented slippery hydrophilic surface technology</strong> developed through the founder’s prior academic research. These surfaces promote dense droplet nucleation while enabling rapid droplet shedding with minimal pinning, reducing re-entrainment and fouling relative to conventional wire or mesh collectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The research evaluates whether combining <strong>controlled airflow interaction</strong> with <strong>low-hysteresis, surface-engineered drainage</strong> can deliver measurable improvements in net water yield per frontal area, particularly under low-wind fog conditions where existing collectors are most limited.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Current focus:</strong> feasibility-scale modeling, benchtop fog testing, and durability evaluation of surface-engineered wire arrays.</p>

      <h2>PhaseJump™ Micro Cooler</h2>
      <p>
        As power densities in electronics continue to rise, passive thermal-management technologies are increasingly constrained by capillary limits, orientation sensitivity, and slow liquid return.
      </p>
      <p>
        PhaseJump™ explores a <strong>surface-driven thermal-management mechanism</strong> in which condensation is transformed into a controlled droplet-generation and ejection process. The concept builds on prior academic advances in <strong>surface-engineered droplet coalescence and ballistic ejection</strong>, extending these principles into compact, sealed device architectures suitable for micro-scale thermal management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engineered condensation surfaces are used to control where droplets nucleate, grow, merge, and eject, enabling rapid liquid recycling without pumps, wicks, or gravity dependence. By replacing capillary-limited condensate return with <strong>surface-mediated droplet transport</strong>, PhaseJump™ aims to establish a new pathway for passive, orientation-independent hotspot cooling.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Current focus:</strong> fabrication and experimental validation of condensation-surface architectures at feasibility scale.</p>
